1. *Morse Code is considered a sequence of binaries. Please read about Morse Code and share the following findings.*
   * What is Morse Code? **The Morse Code is a character encoding used in telecommunication with letters and numbers represented by sound or blinking light patterns. The International Morse Code encodes the 26 English letters from A to Z without distinction between upper and lower cases letters. Basically, each character in Morse code is represented by dash and dot following a standard rule. In fact, the dot is one unit of time, dash is three unit of time, each character of the same word separated by three unit of time and each word separated by seven unit of time. To increase the efficiency of encoding, modern Morse code is designed so that the length of each character equal inverse to the frequency. More code is transmitted via medium such as electric current, radio waves, visible light and sound waves.**

   * Who developed Morse Code? **Following invention of electromagnetic telegraphy in Europe and America in 1824, Samuel F. B. Morse invented early forerunner to the modern International Morse code in 1837. And the Morse system was first used in 1844 to make indentations on a paper tape when electric currents were received.**
